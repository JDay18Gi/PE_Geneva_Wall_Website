			<h2>Theodore Beza</h2>

			<h2>John Calvin</h2>
			<p>John Calvin (/ˈkælvɪn/;[1] French: Jean Calvin, pronounced: [ʒɑ̃ kalvɛ̃]; born Jehan Cauvin: 10 July 1509 – 27 May 1564) was an influential French theologian and pastor during the Protestant Reformation. He was a principal figure in the development of the system of Christian theology later called Calvinism, aspects of which include the doctrine of predestination and the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation of the human soul from death and eternal damnation. In these areas Calvin was influenced by the Augustinian tradition. Various Congregational, Reformed and Presbyterian churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world...<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel">more</a></p>

			<h2>William Farel</h2>
			<p>William Farel (1489 – 13 September 1565), Guilhem Farel or Guillaume Farel (French: [gijom faʁɛl]), was a French evangelist, and a founder of the Reformed Church in the cantons of Neuchâtel, Berne, Geneva, and Vaud in Switzerland. He is most often remembered for having persuaded John Calvin to remain in Geneva in 1536,[1] and for persuading him to return there in 1541,[2] after their expulsion in 1538. They influenced the government of Geneva to the point that it became the "Protestant Rome", where Protestants took refuge and non-Protestants were driven out.[3] Together with Calvin, Farel worked to train missionary preachers who spread the Protestant cause to other countries, and especially to France...<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin">more</a></p>

			<h2>John Knox</h2>
			<p>John Knox (c. 1514 – 24 November 1572) was a Scottish clergyman and writer who was a leader of the Protestant Reformation and is considered the founder of the Presbyterian denomination in Scotland. He is believed to have been educated at the University of St Andrews and worked as a notary-priest. Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, he joined the movement to reform the Scottish church. He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546 and the intervention of the regent of Scotland Mary of Guise. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549...<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knox">more</a></p>
